A (90-100) [hot.png]

"FIRE!!!"
This track is straight heat and majority of listeners agree!
You can't go wrong with putting this on the aux right now.

Okay, this playlist is fire, but to what extent... It's too
popular that it's boring. Try listening to some more "underground"
music genres!



B (80-89) [exquisite.png]

"Exquisite"
This track is great! Although it's not the most popular song,
a good amount of listeners think this track smacks.

This playlist is 


C (70-79) [nice.png]

"Nice"
Your music is cool and respectable.


D (60-69) [shrug.png]

"It's aight"
Your music is okay and you can definitely add some more heat.


F (50-59) [unimpressed.png]

"Trash"
Your music is not it... Please add some fire...


G (40-49) [boring.png]

"Yawn"
Your music is boring at best, and it was very hard to get through.


H (30-39) [bruh.png]

"Straight to the Dumpster"
Your music is indistinguishable from a back alley dumpster.


Z (0-29) [what.png]

"...."
Your music is so unbearable and there are no words to describe the
absence of quality. The only explanation must be that you're intentionally
cooking straight garbage.
